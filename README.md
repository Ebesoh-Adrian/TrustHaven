# TrustHaven

## Project Overview

TrustHaven is an online platform designed to simplify and secure daily transactions and discoveries for people in Cameroon, starting with the city of Buea. It serves as a centralized marketplace and local guide where users can easily find trusted places to live, buy or sell cars, discover local businesses (restaurants, salons), and access various services. Our mission is to eliminate the stress and risks associated with finding reliable listings and services in Cameroon's current digital landscape.

### The Problem TrustHaven Solves

In Cameroon, particularly in towns like Buea, individuals frequently encounter several challenges when seeking goods and services:

* **Time-Consuming Searches:** People spend excessive time sifting through unorganized WhatsApp and Facebook groups to find accommodation, vehicles, or even suitable restaurants.
* **Prevalence of Scams:** Many online listings are fraudulent, leading to a lack of trust and potential financial losses.
* **Limited Visibility for Small Businesses:** Local businesses often struggle to gain visibility due to the high cost of traditional advertising.
* **Lack of Reliable Information for Newcomers:** Students, travelers, and new residents lack a dependable platform to find essential information and services.

### How TrustHaven Provides Solutions

TrustHaven addresses these issues by offering:

1.  **Centralized & Organized Platform:** Consolidating housing, cars, jobs, shops, and services into one easily searchable website/app.
2.  **Verified & Trusted Listings:** Implementing a verification process for all listings to significantly reduce scams and enhance user trust.
3.  **Support for Local Businesses:** Providing free or affordable listing options to boost the visibility of local services.
4.  **Ideal for Newcomers:** Facilitating quick integration for new residents by offering trusted listings and honest reviews.

### Mission Statement

To build a trusted digital space where Cameroonians can easily find what they need — homes, services, deals, and opportunities — without fear, stress, or scams.

### Vision Statement

To become Cameroon's most trusted and complete online hub for everyday needs — starting in Buea, then expanding nationwide. A platform built for the people, by the people, to uplift local businesses and protect everyday buyers.

### Core Features

* **Search & Filter Easily:** Intuitive search functionalities to quickly find desired listings.
* **Verified Profiles:** Assurance of authenticity through verified user and business profiles.
* **User Reviews:** Community-driven feedback to help users make informed decisions.
* **Free & Paid Options:** Flexible listing options to accommodate various user needs and business sizes.
* **Mobile Friendly:** Responsive design for seamless access on all devices.

### Target Audience

TrustHaven is designed for:

* **Students:** Seeking affordable and safe accommodation.
* **Locals:** Looking for trusted mechanics, restaurants, and other services.
* **Landlords:** Aiming to rent out properties securely and efficiently.
* **Car Owners/Dealers:** Facilitating safe and easy buying/selling of vehicles.
* **Anyone:** Frustrated with the unreliability and scams prevalent on existing social media marketplaces.

### Why TrustHaven Will Succeed

Our success is rooted in our focus on critical user needs in Cameroon: **Trust**, **Speed**, **Local Relevance**, and **Affordability**.

### Next Steps to Launch

1.  **User Research:** Conduct in-depth discussions with potential users to understand their specific needs and preferences.
2.  **Platform Development:** Build a foundational version of the platform with core functionalities.
3.  **Content Acquisition:** Manually collect and verify initial listings within Buea.

### Explanation of Key Folders and Files:

* **`.bolt/` & `.qodo/`**: These might be related to specific development tools or configurations unique to your environment. Without further context, their exact purpose is difficult to determine but they are likely not directly part of the React application's core logic.
* **`node_modules/`**: This directory contains all the third-party libraries and packages that your project depends on. It's generated by npm/yarn when you install dependencies.
* **`src/`**: This is the core source code directory for your React application.
    * **`components/`**: This folder houses reusable UI components.
        * **`home/`**: Components specifically designed for the homepage.
        * **`Layout/`**: Components that define the overall layout of the application (e.g., header, footer, navigation).
        * **`listings/`**: Components related to displaying and managing listings.
        * **`ui/`**: Generic, reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, input fields) that can be used across the application.
    * **`pages/`**: This folder typically contains components that represent distinct pages or views in your application.
        * **`auth/`**: Pages related to user authentication (login, registration, password reset).
        * **`HomePage.tsx`**: This is the main component for the landing page of TrustHaven.
        * **`ListingDet...tsx`**: A component for displaying detailed information about a specific listing.
    * **`types/`**: This folder is crucial in TypeScript projects for defining custom data types and interfaces, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

## Working on the Landing Page (`HomePage.tsx`)

The landing page of TrustHaven is primarily handled by the `HomePage.tsx` component, which likely orchestrates the display of various sub-components from the `components/home` and `components/Layout` folders.

### How to Approach Development on `HomePage.tsx`

To work on the landing page, you'll primarily be modifying `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` and potentially creating or updating components within `src/components/home/` and `src/components/Layout/`.

1.  **Understand the Current Structure:**
    * Open `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`. You'll likely see how it imports and renders components like `Hero.tsx`, `Category...tsx`, `FeaturedListing.tsx`, `HowItWorks.tsx`, and `Testimonials.tsx`.
    * Examine the components within `src/components/home/` to understand their individual responsibilities and props.
    * Familiarize yourself with `src/components/Layout/Navbar.tsx` and `src/components/Layout/Footer.tsx`, as these will frame the landing page content.

2.  **Identify Required Changes:**
    * Based on the project's goals (e.g., "Search & Filter Easily," "Verified & Trusted Listings," "Helps Local Businesses Grow"), determine what new sections or modifications are needed on the landing page.
    * For example, you might need:
        * A prominent search bar.
        * Sections highlighting "verified listings."
        * A call-to-action for "local businesses to list for free."

3.  **Implement Changes (Example Scenario):**

    Let's say you want to add a section about "Helping Local Businesses Grow" on the landing page.

    * **Step 1: Create a New Component (if necessary):**
        If the content is complex, create a new reusable component in `src/components/home/`. For example, `LocalBusinessCTA.tsx`:

        ```typescript jsx
        // src/components/home/LocalBusinessCTA.tsx
        import React from 'react';

        const LocalBusinessCTA: React.FC = () => {
          return (
            <section className="local-business-cta">
              <h2>Help Your Local Business Thrive!</h2>
              <p>Get noticed by thousands of potential customers in Buea. List your business on TrustHaven for free or choose our affordable premium options.</p>
              <button>List Your Business Now</button>
            </section>
          );
        };

        export default LocalBusinessCTA;
        ```

    * **Step 2: Integrate into `HomePage.tsx`:**
        Import and use your new component within `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` at the appropriate place in the render order.

        ```typescript jsx
        // src/pages/HomePage.tsx
        import React from 'react';
        import Hero from '../components/home/Hero';
        import FeaturedListing from '../components/home/FeaturedListing';
        // ... other imports
        import LocalBusinessCTA from '../components/home/LocalBusinessCTA'; // Import your new component
        import Navbar from '../components/Layout/Navbar';
        import Footer from '../components/Layout/Footer';

        const HomePage: React.FC = () => {
          return (
            <>
              <Navbar />
              <main>
                <Hero />
                <FeaturedListing />
                {/* Add your new component here */}
                <LocalBusinessCTA />
                {/* ... other home components */}
              </main>
              <Footer />
            </>
          );
        };

        export default HomePage;
        ```

    * **Step 3: Style the Component:**
        Add corresponding CSS rules in `src/index.css` or create a dedicated CSS module if your project uses them (though not explicitly shown in the current structure).

        ```css
        /* src/index.css */
        .local-business-cta {
          padding: 40px 20px;
          text-align: center;
          background-color: #f8f8f8;
          margin-top: 40px;
        }

        .local-business-cta h2 {
          color: #333;
          margin-bottom: 15px;
        }

        .local-business-cta p {
          max-width: 700px;
          margin: 0 auto 20px auto;
          line-height: 1.6;
        }

        .local-business-cta button {
          background-color: #4CAF50; /* Example color */
          color: white;
          padding: 12px 25px;
          border: none;
          border-radius: 5px;
          cursor: pointer;
          font-size: 16px;
        }

        .local-business-cta button:hover {
          opacity: 0.9;
        }
        ```

4.  **Testing:**
    * Run your development server (`npm start` or `yarn start` if configured, or `npm run dev` / `yarn dev` if using Vite defaults) to see your changes in the browser.
    * Test responsiveness on different screen sizes.

5.  **Git Workflow:**
    * **Create a new branch:** Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/landing-page-improvements`
    * **Commit regularly:** As you make progress, commit your changes with clear messages: `git commit -m "feat: Add Local Business CTA to landing page"`
    * **Push to GitHub:** Once your work is complete and tested, push your branch to GitHub: `git push origin feature/landing-page-improvements`
    * **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Go to your GitHub repository and open a Pull Request from your branch to the main branch (e.g., `main` or `develop`) for review.

By following these steps, you can effectively contribute to the TrustHaven landing page development, ensuring a clear and organized approach.
